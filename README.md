# CRSFtoPWM  
  
A board to provide up to 10 PWM servo outputs using an inexpensive serial ELRS receiver.  Tested with a BetaFPV Nano 2400 Rx  
Includes a pressure sensor for baro altitude and vertical speed telemetery. 
  
### Features:  
* 8 PWM servo outputs with adjustable update rate from 50Hz to 333Hz
* 2 PWM outputs fixed at 50Hz
* Optional SBus output of all channels
* Altitude and VSpeed telemetry over ELRS/CRSF
* Rx battery telemetry over ELRS
* Vbat from 2S to 6S or optionally from servo rail
* Extra UART port can be configured for gps telemetry, debugging, or Betaflight passthrough for ELRS rx firmware updates
* Extra I2C port for future expansion?
* Windows client software for configuration over a USB-Serial (FTDI etc.) connection.
